---

Let AI agents (or any untrusted binary) roam freely inside a lightweight
sandbox VM that boots in seconds, has scriptable network control, and can run
any Linux-based OCI image. A single self-contained, daemonless binary — no
Docker required. Works on both macOS and Linux.

![Demo](docs/manual/src/demo.svg)

## Features

- **Configuration as code** — share sandbox setup with your team via a single TOML file.
- **Full network control** — allow or deny connections and individual HTTP
  requests, inject API keys with Lua-scriptable middleware, and inspect VM
  traffic in real time.
- **Presets** — secure defaults for Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub
  Copilot CLI out of the box (PRs welcome for more).
- **File & directory mounts** — share project files with the agent and nothing more.
- **File attachments** — drop images and files into sandbox terminals.
- **Host port & socket forwarding** — reach the host's PostgreSQL, Redis, or Docker.
- **Agent hook integration** — surface network denials back to the agent so it
  sees *why* a tool failed and can stop to ask instead of retrying blindly.

## Quick start

OBS! This quickstart uses Claude Code as the example, but airlock itself
is agent-agnostic. See the other agent
[presets](https://milankinen.github.io/airlock/presets.html) for your
favourite agent's setup.

### 1. Install `airlock`

The GitHub [releases](https://github.com/milankinen/airlock/releases) page
has prebuilt binaries. Download the latest one for the current user:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/milankinen/airlock/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh

# The installer places the airlock binary under ~/.local/bin, so add
# that to your PATH to make it available.
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

### 2. Start your first sandbox

Navigate to your project directory and start the VM with the default config.
This creates a placeholder `airlock.toml`, spins up an `alpine:3` sandbox,
and mounts your project directory into it.

```bash
$ airlock start
```

### 3. Set up Claude Code

Edit the project's `airlock.toml` and add the `claude-code` preset. It:

* Adds network
  [allow rules](https://milankinen.github.io/airlock/configuration/network.html)
  for the Anthropic APIs.
* [Masks](https://milankinen.github.io/airlock/configuration/env.html#masking)
  your API token — the sandbox only sees a random surrogate — and
  [injects](https://milankinen.github.io/airlock/configuration/network.html#injecting-masked-secrets)
  the real value into Claude's requests on the host side —
  **your token is never exposed to the sandbox**.
* Creates Claude placeholder settings under `~/.airlock/claude` and
  [mounts](https://milankinen.github.io/airlock/configuration/mounts.html)
  them into the sandbox so settings persist across sandboxes (you can turn
  this off if you prefer per-sandbox or per-session settings).

You also need an OCI image that ships Claude. We use
`docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code` as an example. At this point you can
also set the
[network policy](https://milankinen.github.io/airlock/configuration/network.html)
to deny all outbound traffic by default unless explicitly allowed by the
network rules.

The complete `airlock.toml` looks like this:

```toml
presets = ["claude-code"]

[network]
policy = "deny-by-default"

[vm]
image = "docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code"
```

### 4. Provide the Claude Code token

The preset expects the Claude authentication token in the
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. You can obtain one by
running `claude setup-token`.

If you'd rather not keep the token in plaintext on your filesystem, store
it in the
[airlock secret vault](https://milankinen.github.io/airlock/secrets.html).
Airlock uses your OS keyring (macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service) so you
only get prompted when airlock actually needs the value. Secrets are shared
across sandboxes, so setting the token once covers every later sandbox as
well. Add a secret with `airlock secrets`:

```bash
$ airlock secrets add CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
✔ Value · ********
✔ stored secret CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
```

### 5. Yolo

Start the sandboxed Claude and start coding! You probably also want to
launch the airlock
[monitor dashboard](https://milankinen.github.io/airlock/usage/monitor.html)
to inspect network traffic and flip the network policy live — for example,
to briefly allow network access while tools install:

```bash
$ airlock start --monitor -- claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

![Monitor dashboard](docs/manual/src/usage/monitor.png)

[File attachments](docs/manual/src/usage/file-attachments.md) work in regular
terminal mode, `--monitor`, and `airlock exec`. Airlock copies external files
into a read-only share, so agents such as Claude Code attach dropped images
as usual.

for the full details.

## License

### Source code

All Rust source code in this repository is dual-licensed under **MIT OR Apache-2.0**
at your option, except [initramfs](app/vm-initramfs) and [kernel](app/vm-kernel)
that are licensed under **GPLv2** (deriving from Linux license).

### Pre-built binaries

Two variants are available on the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/milankinen/airlock/releases) page:

* **Bundled** (default, installed by `install.sh`) — includes an
  airlock-compatible Linux VM (kernel and initramfs). The bundled VM component
  is GPLv2; the airlock binary itself remains MIT OR Apache-2.0.
* **Distroless** (`install.sh --distroless`) — does not bundle any kernel or
  initramfs. Licensed entirely under MIT OR Apache-2.0.

When using the distroless build, you must supply your own kernel and initramfs
with the capabilities required by the `airlockd` supervisor.
